                <h3>Independent Clause</h3>
                <p>Thankfully, you don't need a deep dive into grammar to succeed on the ACT or SAT - you just need a few key building blocks.<br><br>
                
                A <b>clause</b> is a unit of grammatical organization that consists of a subject and verb, while a <b>phrase</b> is a group of words without a subject-verb relationship.<br><br>
                
                An independent clause consists of a subject, verb, and complete thought. It may stand on its own or mix with other clauses to form a complete sentence. </p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>The freshmen were nervous about their upcoming exam.</p></div>
                
                <p>Sentences consisting of a single independent clause can get surprisingly short. Telling someone "Go!" gives you a verb - <i>to go</i> - and an implied subject: <i>you,</i> the poor person you're yelling at.</p>
                
                <h3>Dependent Clause</h3>
                <p>A dependent clause also contains a subject and verb, but it must be attached to an independent clause to form a sentence.</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>When they arrived in class...</p></div>
                
                <p>Usually, dependent clauses leave you asking 'What happened?' or 'What's next?' <br><br>They are often accompanied by <b>dependent markers</b>. Click to view the list below: </p>
                
                <label class="collapsible">
                  <input type="checkbox" />
                  <div class="bar"><span class="collapser">Dependent Markers</span></div><span class="arrow"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i></span>
                  <span class="collapsed"><div class="bar2"> after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar1">even though, if, in order to, since, though, unless, until</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar2">whatever, when, whenever, whether, while</div></span>
                </label>
                
                <h3>Fragments</h3>
                <p>Sentence fragments typically consist of dependent clauses or phrases, and are therefore considered incomplete. Your job on the ACT/SAT is to fix any fragments you find. Let's look at a few examples.<br><br>
                
                <b>Double-click your answer when you are ready.</b></p>
                
                <div class="examplegrid"><div class="exampletext">When gravity causes the gas and dust to <u>collapse. Stars form.</u></div><div class="exampleanswers"><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation1')"><b>A.</b> NO CHANGE</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation1')"><b>B.</b> collapse and form stars.</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation1')"><b>C.</b> collapse to form stars.</span><br><span class="right" onclick="toggle_visibility('examplecorrect1');"><b>D.</b> collapse, stars form.</span></div></div>
                
                <div id="exampleexplanation1"><p>"Stars form" is a complete sentence, but the dependent marker "when" sets up a dependent clause that needs to be attached to something else, so Choice A isn't our best bet. Choice B keeps this whole sentence a dependent fragment - "When gravity causes the gast and dust to collapse and form stars." ... Then what?<br><br>
                    
                    Choice C does the same thing: "When gravity causes the gas and dust to collapse to form stars." ... Something's gotta happen.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Choice D</b> tells us that after the collapse hapens, stars form.</p></div>
                
                <div id="examplecorrect1"><p><b class="emphasis" style="color:lightgreen">CORRECT!</b> Choice D connects the dependent clause in the first bit to the independent clause "stars form."</p></div><br>
                
                <div class="examplegrid"><div class="exampletext"><u>Over 90 degrees today,</u> we're going to the ocean.</div><div class="exampleanswers"><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>A.</b> NO CHANGE</span><br><span class="right" onclick="toggle_visibility('examplecorrect')"><b>B.</b> Since it's over 90 degrees today,</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>C.</b> With over 90 degrees today,</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>D.</b>But it's over 90 degree's today,</span></div></div>
                
                <div id="exampleexplanation"><p>We need to properly set up the first part of this sentence so that it is dependent on the clause "we're going to the ocean." Choice C suggests we're going to do soemthing "with" the 90 degrees, and choice D sets up a contrast with the conjunction "but."<br><br>
                    
                Therefore, <b>Choice B</b> fits best. Since it's really hot out, we're going to the ocean.</p></div><br>
                
                <div id="examplecorrect"><p><b class="emphasis" style="color:lightgreen">CORRECT!</b> The test makers want you to carefully pick words to establish dependent and independent clauses.</p></div>
                
                <h3>Intervening Phrase/Clause</h3>
                <p>Questions that include an intervening phrase or clause are trying to distract you from the sentence's main subject-verb relationship.<br><br>
                
                Generally, you can remove an intervening phrase/clause and the sentence will still make sense. These bits are meant to be bracketed off with commas, so you know they aren't essential to the sentence.</p>
                
                <div class="example"><p>The lizard, <u>basking on a rock under the warm sun</u>, was frightened off by the sound of racing ATVs.</p></div> 
                
                <p>Without the underlined intervening clause, the sentence becomes:</p>
                
                <div class="example"><p>The lizard was frightened off by the sound of racing ATVs.</p></div>
                
                <p>What's wrong with the sentence below?</p>
                
                <div class="wrongexample"><p>Your textbook, <u>as well as your new backpack and waterbottle</u>, are expected to arrive tomorrow.</p></div>
                
                <p>If we remove the intervening phrase...</p>
                
                <div class="wrongexample"><p>Your textbook <b>are</b> expected to arrive tomorrow.</p></div>
                
                <p>You may think you need a verb that agrees with everything involved in that list - here, we don't need to do that, because the new backpack and waterbottle are mentioned as extraneous information. I'm just concerned about the textbook. The way to fix this sentence, while keeping the intervening clause, would look like this: </p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>Your textbook, as well as your new backpack and waterbottle, <b>is</b> expected to arrive tomorrow.</p></div>
                    
                <h3>TEST TIP</h3>
                <p>When you're dealing with complex sentences, ask yourself this: <b>"Who's doing what?"</b><br><br>
                
                Keep track of your subjects in a sentence, and look out for any floating verbs that don't appear to have anyone attached to them.</p>
                
                <div class="examplegrid"><div class="exampletext">Standing under a falling anvil, <u>the yelling barely audible because of</u> the loud New York traffic. </div><div class="exampleanswers"><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation2')"><b>A.</b> NO CHANGE</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation2')"><b>B.</b> the yelling wasn't audible due to</span><br><span class="right" onclick="toggle_visibility('examplecorrect2');"><b>C.</b> I barely heard the yelling over</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation2')"><b>D.</b> I barely heard the yelling having</span></div></div>
                
                
                <div id="exampleexplanation2"><p>There's a few things going on - one, somebody's standing under a falling anvil. Two, there's yelling that's barely audible over traffic. Assuming the person about to be squished is the one trying to listen in the underlined part, we need to introduce them as the subject of this sentence.<br><br>
                
                Choice B shuffles some words around, but doesn't introduce a subject. Choice D introduces the dependent marker "having," which sets up a dependent clause that we'd have to fix further. <br><br>
                
                <b>Choice C</b> is our best answer - "I" am standing under the anvil, and struggling to hear people yelling at me to watch out.<br><br>
                
                I'll go ahead and step out of harm's way. See you in the next lesson!<br><br></p>
