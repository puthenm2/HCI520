                <h3>Serial Commas</h3>
                <p>Also known as the <b>Oxford Comma,</b> these commas are used after the second to last item in a list of 3+ items, before the and/or. Many consider this a stylistic choice, meaning serial commas aren't required to get your point across. On the ACT and SAT, however, you're expected to include them. You never know what kinds of misunderstandings you can create without them!<br><br>
                
                How does this sentence look without commas?</p>
                
                <div class="wrongexample"><p>I find inspiration in cooking my family and my pets.</p></div>

                <p>I'm doing <i>what</i> now? Quick, throw in the serial comma!</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>I find inspiration in <u>cooking</u>, <u>my family</u>, and <u>my pets</u>.</p></div>
                
                <p>Phew! This makes me look way less dangerous. Now, it's clear I'm just inspired by a list of three things.</p>

                  <span class="collapsed"><div class="bar2">We invited the circus tamers <b class="emphasis">,</b> Fred <b class="emphasis">,</b> and George.</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar1">I had eggs <b class="emphasis">,</b> toast <b class="emphasis">,</b> and orange juice for breakfast.</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar2">Anna would like to visit France <b class="emphasis">,</b> Italy <b class="emphasis">,</b> and Spain someday.</div>

                </label>
                
                <h3>With Adjectives</h3>
                <p>When describing a word with two or more adjectives, use commas to separate them.</p>
                
                 <div class="wrongexample"><p>The Midwest is famous for its sprawling <b class="emphasis">,</b> corn fields.</p></div>
                
                <p>Why isn't the sentence above a good example of this rule? You can think of a "corn field" as a distinct entity - in other words, "corn" is not an adjective describing "fields." </p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>There's a lot of vast <b class="emphasis">,</b> empty <b class="emphasis">,</b> open space in the Midwest.</p></div>
                
                <p>Here, "space" is described as vast <i>and</i> empty <i>and</i> open.</p>
                
                <h3>With Conjunctions</h3>
                <div class="table">
                    <div class="bar"><b>Coordinating Conjunctions</b></div>
                    <div class="bar2">For</div>
                    <div class="bar1">And</div>
                    <div class="bar2">Not</div>
                    <div class="bar1">But</div>
                    <div class="bar2">Or</div>
                    <div class="bar1">Yet</div>
                    <div class="bar2">So</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>We use conjunctions to connect words, and they're especially useful for stitching together clauses and phrases.</p>
                
                <div class="examplegrid"><div class="exampletext">My mother's birthday is the week before Mother's <u>Day so we</u> do a big celebration in-between.</div><div class="exampleanswers"><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>A.</b> NO CHANGE</span><br><span class="right" onclick="toggle_visibility('examplecorrect')"><b>B.</b> Day, so we</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>C.</b> Day so, we</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>D.</b> Day, so we,</span></div></div>
                
                <div id="exampleexplanation"><p>We need a comma somewhere, but you should never pick Choice C. Commas don't come after conjunctions. <br><br>
                    
                Additionally, the test makers like to sneak in commas at the end of answer choices - so beware the trap of Choice D that puts a comma after "we."
                    
                <b>Choice B</b> correctly displays a comma-conjunction pair.</p></div>
                
                <div id="examplecorrect"><p><b class="emphasis" style="color:lightgreen">CORRECT! Put your commas before your conjunctions.</b></p></div><br>
                
                <h3>Introductory Words</h3>
                <p>Use a comma when you begin with a transition or other introductory words.</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>Well <b class="emphasis">,</b> I suppose we could make room in our schedule for a meeting next week.</p></div><br>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>Truth be told <b class="emphasis">,</b> we've never interviewed anyone quite so famous.</p></div><br>
                <h3>Interrupters &#38; Parentheticals</h3>
                <p>As discussed in the Intervening Phrase/Clause section of Lesson 1, you will find extra pieces of information that can be taken out, while keeping the meaning of a sentence intact.<br><br>
                
                For example:</p>
                
                <div class="example"><p>Sticking with the violin through high school, <u>I believe</u>, taught me the value of self-discipline.</p></div>
                
                <p>The phrase "I believe" is an interrupter, so it should be set off, or bracketed, by commas. In other words, the phrase is <b>nonessential</b>. So, what happens when a phrase or clause is <b>essential</b> to understanding the meaning of the sentence? See below:</p>
                
                <div class="example"><p>The woman <u>who left her purse</u> is coming back for it.</p></div>
                
                <p>Take out the underlined information and the sentence becomes: </p>
                
                <div class="wrongexample"><p>The woman is coming back for it.</p></div>
                
                <p>While not strictly incorrect, the sentence is confusing - we don't know what "it" is.</p>

                  <div class="bar"><span class="collapser">Other Examples</span></div><span class="arrow"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i></span>
                  <span class="collapsed"><div class="bar2">Chicago <b class="emphasis">,</b> otherwise known as the Windy City <b class="emphasis">,</b> officially became a city in 1837.</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar1">Shakespeare's longest play <b class="emphasis">,</b> <i>Hamlet</i> <b class="emphasis">,</b> is also his most popular.</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar2">My cousin <b class="emphasis">,</b> who goes to school in New Orleans <b class="emphasis">,</b> invited me to stay with him for Mardi Gras.</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar1">On the day <u>that Lincoln died</u>, friends and foes mourned him.</div>
                    
                    <div class="bar2">The man <u>who bought five pounds of beef yesterday</u> claims he owns a pet alligator.</div>

                    <div class="bar1">The dress <u>that I purchased last week</u> already has a hole in the skirt.</div></span>

                <h3>Beware the Comma Splice</h3>
                <p>When stitching together complex sentences with many different clauses, you'll want to be careful with your comma usage. A comma splice happens when you try to combine independent clauses by just using a flimsy comma. This can be fixed in three ways:</p>
                
                <div class="wrongexample"><p>The professor hosted a review session for the last class before the exam, several students had neglected to show up.</p></div>
                
                <p>With a comma-conjunction:</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>The professor hosted a review session for the last class before the exam <b class="emphasis">, but</b> several students had neglected to show up.</p></div>
                
                <p>With a semicolon:</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>The professor hosted a review session for the last class before the exam <b class="emphasis">;</b> several students had neglected to show up.</p></div>
                
                <p>With a period:</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>The professor hosted a review session for the last class before the exam <b class="emphasis">.</b> Several students had neglected to show up.</p></div>
                
                <p>We'll expand on the semicolon in Lesson 3 and the period in Lesson 5. Commas are versatile and incredibly useful punctuation marks when it comes to organization and making sentences readable. Just make sure you're using them deliberately, following the rules, and taking a moment to decide, "Do I really need a pause here?"</p>
