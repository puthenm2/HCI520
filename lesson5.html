                <h3>NOTE</h3>
                <p>You've made it to the last lesson! If you'd like to review previous concepts before tackling the post-test, visit the <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a>. On previous lessons, you can click the interrobang ( <img src="favicon.png" style="width: 16px;"> ) icon in the upper right to access the Table of Contents.</p>
                <h3>Parentheses</h3>
                <p>Parentheses set off explanations and other remarks. (Remember <b>parentheticals</b> from Lesson 2?) Like commas, parentheses set off pieces that could be removed from the sentence without affecting the meaning.</p> 
                
                    <div class="rightexample"><p>Marcus <b class="emphasis">(</b>a lifelong fan of the Cubs<b class="emphasis">)</b> was thoroughly vindicated by his favorite team's win in 2016.</p></div>
                
                <p>Punctuation always goes outside parentheses unless the parenthetical is a complete sentence.</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>Evelyn removed every trace of the project from her portfolio. <b class="emphasis">(</b>She insisted employers wouldn't want to see prototypes with the word "incorporated" spelled incorrectly.<b class="emphasis">)</b></p></div>
                
                <h3>Dashes</h3>
                <p>Dashes may be used to indicate a sudden break, transition, or abrupt change, but they also serve as a way to frame parentheticals. They highlight the information where a pair of parentheses would set it aside. On standardized tests, dashes are (almost) always paired.</p>
                
                <div class="examplegrid"><div class="exampletext">David tends to <u>experiment with</u> jobs, classes, recipes, outfits, and most other things—before he ever commits to a decision.</div><div class="exampleanswers"><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>A.</b> NO CHANGE</span><br><span class="right" onclick="toggle_visibility('examplecorrect')"><b>B.</b> experiment—with</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>C.</b> experiment, with</span><br><span class="wrong" onclick="toggle_visibility('exampleexplanation')"><b>D.</b> experiment with,</span></div></div>
                
                <div id="exampleexplanation"><p>Often, the test makers will sneak in a dash above or below the underlined portion for the question, so make sure you're paying close attention to the whole passage!<br><br>Check the dash after "things" - that means we need to pair it with <b>Choice B.</b> However, if there had been a comma after "things," we would want Choice C. Choice D's comma incorrectly separates what David does ("experiment with") to his jobs, classes, etc.</p></div>
                
                <div id="examplecorrect"><p><b class="emphasis" style="color:lightgreen">CORRECT!</b> Often, the test makers will sneak in a dash above or below the underlined portion for the question, so make sure you're paying close attention to the whole passage!</p></div>
                
                <h3>Periods</h3>
                <p>On the ACT/SAT, you may be asked to do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove a period after an incomplete sentence</li>
                    <li>Use a period to break up a run-on sentence</li>
                    <li>Use a period for an abbreviation - make sure you keep necessary commas, i.e. "Martin Luther King, Jr., was born on January 15, 1929."</li>
                    <li>Ensure a period is the best end mark for a sentence, and not a question mark or exclamation point.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Question Marks</h3>
                <p>You'd think using question marks on the ACT/SAT is easy, right? Well, make sure that when you see <b>tag questions</b>, like the "right?" tacked onto the end of the previous sentence, you place a comma before the phrase.</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>How else would you expect our stellar students to perform<b class="emphasis">,</b> after all <b class="emphasis">?</b></p></div><br>
                
                <h3>Exclamation Points</h3>
                <p>Honestly? You're probably only going to see exclamation points (used for emphatic interjections, declarations, and commands) at the end of the test. Oh well!</p>
                
                <img id="stop" src="images/stop!.png" alt="Instructions for students to STOP! once they've finished the ACT English section."><br>
                
                <h3>Quotation Marks</h3>
                <p>Periods and commas always go inside quotation marks, while the placement of a question mark varies based on context. There are single (' ') and double (" ") quotation marks. Double quotes are used for <b>direct quotes</b>.</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p><b class="emphasis">"</b> There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,<b class="emphasis">"</b> he answered, laughing.</p></div>
                
                <p>In the above example, Sherlock Holmes is speaking aloud in a direct quote. Marks are not needed for <b>indrect quotes</b>, as in the following example:</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>Watson said he would prefer to skip out on this upcoming case. Unfortunately, he had to fulfill his role as the series narrator.</p></div>
                
                <p>If you happen to be quoting someone quoting someone else, it might look something like this:</p>
                
                <div class="rightexample"><p>"And then," Lyra exclaimed, outraged, <b class="emphasis">"</b> She asked, <b>'</b> Are you sure you don't want to take a break? <b>'</b> <b class="emphasis">"</b></p></div>
                
                <p>Notice how the double and single quotes are nested to show that that Lyra is speaking aloud, and quoting someone else asking her a question.<br><br>
                
                Keep punctuation simple in the case of quotes - you shouldn't need to mix end marks, or double up on your question marks.</p>
